# Text Summarization with Transformers: *The Mandalorian* episode scripts

Roberto Andrade

**Introduction**

Due to the importance Natural Language Processing has, its seemingly limitless potential, and the great amount of models that are now readily available for it, it was of great interest to try and implement one of these models to perform a useful task. This project focused on text summarization.

As the title suggests, the topic was episode scripts from a TV show. In particular, seasons 1 and 2 from *The Mandalorian*, as well as season 1 from *The Book of Boba Fett*. The scripts were taken from [here](https://starwars.fandom.com/), and the model used to summarize them was T5-base, leveraging [transformers](https://huggingface.co/).

For a more detailed explanation on how the program worked, please check the [Model_explanation.ipynb](https://github.com/roberto-andrade22/MandoTextAnalytics/blob/main/Model_explanation.ipynb) file. To read the summarized scripts, please check the [summaries.md](https://github.com/roberto-andrade22/MandoTextAnalytics/blob/main/output/summaries.md) file in the output folder.

This is the Way.
